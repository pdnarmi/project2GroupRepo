                <br />
                <p>In case you didn't notice, this is not (technically) a real service. However ... you'll love it anyway!! </p>
                <p>Our names are Georgette Bondarek, Alex Nordin, Gabriel Rivera, Patrick Narmi, Ella Thompson, and Benjamin Smith. We are students at the University of North Carolina Coding Boot Camp working on our second group project.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Our goal is to create an interactive experience for the user incorporating different application programming interfaces (API's), using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Structured Query Language (SQL), as well as incorporating a new technological development which our instructor has not yet discussed with us in class.</p>
                <p>Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which was summarized in the description on the login page, is a user-friendly member-based web application which is used specifically to watch, review, and archive the best movies.</p>
                <p>The new technology that we ended up using was Algolia, an API-based technology in which the system recognizes potential searches as a person types them in and displays it to the user.</p>
                <br />
                <p>It is our hope that all who visit this site are able to utilize and, more importantly, enjoy what we have put together for you!</p>
