**User Story**<br>
As a person that watches many movies, Im sure you are always looking for new ones to watch. But how do you remember each movie you have watched and if you would watch it again?  FilmStache is an application that allows you to Search. Watch. and Review. the movie that you have seen and cateogorizes it into your own personal library.  You will be able to search for those movies you watched and read the review you gave it to see if you want to watch it again.

The project represents the 2nd group project for the six contributors enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp fall of 2020.
